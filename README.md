# synthetic_image_generation_alongwith_3d_pose
# this code has been used in "Implementation experiments on convolutional neural network training using synthetic images for 3D pose estimation of an excavator on real images"
# use these files in unity to generate synthetic image and corresponding 3d pose
# camera_rotation.cs and capture_image_and_pose.cs files are attached to camera of unity to capture and save data.
# Attach files of random_rotation_xx.cs to excavator elements for radom rotations.
